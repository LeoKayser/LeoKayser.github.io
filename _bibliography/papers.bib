  abstract={Polynomial equations and their solutions play a ubiquitous role both for theoretical and
practical applications. A closely related problem is that of ideal membership, i. e. deciding
whether a polynomial is a linear combination of other polynomials. Gröbner bases provide
a well-developed machinery to deal with these problems symbolically as a part of computer
algebra systems. In this thesis we give an introduction to the theory of Gröbner bases with a
view towards computational complexity. In particular, we discuss algorithmic aspects and up-
per bounds depending on the classes of polynomials considered. Furthermore, lower bounds
on the size and computational complexity of Gröbner bases and related problems are pre-
sented. While often useful in practice, the worst-case complexity of Gröbner bases is located
in $\textsf{EXPSPACE}$.},

  title={Hilbert Functions of Chopped Ideals}, 
  abstract={A chopped ideal is obtained from a homogeneous ideal by considering only the generators of a fixed degree. We investigate cases in which the chopped ideal defines the same finite set of points as the original one-dimensional ideal. The complexity of computing these points from the chopped ideal is governed by the Hilbert function and regularity. We conjecture values for these invariants and prove them in many cases. We show that our conjecture is of practical relevance for symmetric tensor decomposition.},
