Hi, I'm Leo, a PhD student in math at the [Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences](https://www.mis.mpg.de/) in Leipzig. I'm a member of the [Nonlinear Algebra group](https://www.mis.mpg.de/nlalg/research.html), my advisor is [Simon Telen](https://simontelen.webnode.page/). I am interested in (Commutative) Algebra and Algebraic Geometry with a view towards computation and applications.

I studied both mathematics and computer science at the [Leibniz University Hanover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/) from 2016 to 2022. I wrote my master's theses on [*The Waring problem for polynomials: Geometry and applications*](/assets/pdf/The_Waring_problem_for_polynomials.pdf) and [*Gröbner Bases and Their Complexity*](/assets/pdf/Gr%C3%B6bner_Bases_and_Their_Complexity.pdf) respectively.
