As my first *ever* blog post on here and also as a mathematical Christmas gift, I wanted to share my favorite proof of the infinitude of prime numbers.

**Theorem.** There are infinitely many prime numbers $$p \in \mathbb{Z}$$.

The following proof uses some basic results of algebraic number theory, which I'll now recall.

**Lemma 1.** The integral closure $$\mathcal O$$ of $$\ZZ$$ in $$K = \QQ(\sqrt{-5})$$ is $$\ZZ(\sqrt{-5})$$


*Proof of Theorem.*
